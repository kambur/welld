WellD Programming Test

Getting Started
Computer vision involves analyzing patterns in visual images and reconstructing the real-world objects that produced them. 
The process is often broken up into two phases: feature detection and pattern recognition. 
Feature detection involves selecting important features of the image; pattern recognition involves discovering patterns in the features. 
We will investigate a particularly clean pattern recognition problem involving points and line segments. 
This kind of pattern recognition arises in many other applications such as statistical data analysis.

Please clone this repo/master to your local and build using mvn. 

Prerequisites
Java17 GIT Maven IDE (IntelliJ IDEA)

Setup and run local development endevelopment

Start project: 
1. From IDE 
  You can run a Spring Boot application from your IDE as a simple Java application, however, first you will need to import your project. Import steps will vary depending on your IDE and build system. Most IDEs can import Maven projects directly, for example Eclipse users can select Import…​ → Existing Maven Projects from the File menu.
  If you can’t directly import your project into your IDE, you may be able to generate IDE metadata using a build plugin. Maven includes plugins for Eclipse and IDEA; Gradle offers plugins for various IDEs.

2. Using the Maven plugin
  Go to project root dir and start run in command line: **mvn spring-boot:run **

Use resource POSTMAN collection located in /postman dir.
